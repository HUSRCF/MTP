# MTP Expert Prefetch Progress

## Progress Version

- Version: `v0.4-scale512-action-runtime`
- Updated: 2026-05-05
- Current phase: 512-sample scale-up validation for action-level runtime policy

## Runtime Policy Contract

The current runtime MVP policy is:

```text
transition_top32 protected base
+ full_fetch: up to MTP_extra4, utility gate
+ metadata: up to MTP_extra1, raw-score high-tail, high-overlap/idle only
+ premap: independent tiny descriptor budget
+ skip: default fallback
```

Safety boundaries:

- True router remains authoritative.
- Predictions never change logits or executed routed experts.
- Only `full_fetch` enters ready-before-demand and stall proxy.
- `metadata` and `premap` are setup-preparation actions only.
- MTP extras must be novel additions and cannot replace `transition_top32`.

## Passed Gates

- vLLM router recorder labels are trusted.
- Same-token router hidden oracle passed.
- MTP token path alignment passed after `prefc` concat fix.
- Native MTP router-only predictor is frozen as a negative baseline.
- MTP-token prior is promoted only as extra-budget candidate expansion.
- Utility-gated `full_fetch` beats fixed extraK on issued-byte efficiency.
- Action-level counters report `full_fetch` / `metadata` / `premap` / `skip`.
- Metadata and premap are tracked with separate setup-prep accounting.

## Current Scale-Up

512-sample configs are committed in:

- `configs/data/aya_dataset_512.yaml`
- `configs/trace/router_mtp_trace_aya_dataset_autoround_512sample.yaml`
- `configs/trace/router_mtp_trace_aya_dataset_awq_vllm_512sample.yaml`
- `configs/eval/prefetch_shadow_512sample_mtp_extra.yaml`

Active chain:

1. AutoRound 512 trace on GPU0.
2. vLLM AWQ router-recorder 512 trace on GPU1.
3. Merge AutoRound MTP and vLLM router labels.
4. Rebuild fixed MTP token top-M sidecar.
5. Run 512-sample tensor-cache event/action validation.
6. Sweep broader bandwidth / layer-time / MTP-delay envelope.

## Primary 512 Validation Questions

- Does `transition_top32 + up to MTP_extra4 + utility gate` keep its Pareto advantage?
- Do action-level later-used rates preserve ordering: `full_fetch > metadata > premap`?
- Does metadata max1 remain high-overlap/opportunistic rather than default-expanded?
- Does premap remain positive only as tiny/idle descriptor prep?
- Are 512-scale results consistent with 256-sample conclusions?

## Current Default Evaluation Settings

```text
transition_topk = 32
mtp_topk = 64
default full_fetch max_extra = 4
high-budget max_extra = 8
metadata max_extra = 1
metadata score ratio = 0.95
premap max_extra = 1
admission capacity per layer = 160
calibrated H2D bandwidth = 6.589 GB/s
layer time = 1.0 ms
MTP delay = 2.0 ms
action cost overlap = 0.90
```
